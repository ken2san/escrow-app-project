# Waritsu Development Guidelines: Building the Infrastructure for Trust and Fair Work

> **About the Name**
>
> **Waritsu（ワリツ）** is a coined word, derived from the Japanese characters 「和」 (wa, meaning harmony/peace) and 「律」 (ritsu, meaning law/principle). The name embodies the vision of a system that balances harmony and fairness through clear rules and mutual respect.

## Vision

Waritsu is not just a transaction tool, but a **trustless platform designed to guarantee trust and fairness by design**—an infrastructure for fair work in society. By leveraging blockchain and AI, Waritsu ensures reliability through system architecture, not operator discretion. This eliminates information asymmetry, reduces uncertainty in digital work, and maximizes user autonomy by minimizing operational intervention.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Why Build This App?

Waritsu exists to solve the challenges of modern work and enable more human, sustainable ways of working.

- **Beyond Survival:** Work should offer meaning and joy, not just a means to survive.
- **Beyond Superficial Approval:** True trust is built on the quality and impact of work, not on social media-style popularity.
- **Pursuing Fair Connections:** Build relationships based on shared purpose and fair distribution of effort and reward.
- **No Exploitation of Motivation:** The system guarantees fair transactions so that no one’s skills or passion are unfairly used.
- **Eliminating Unnecessary Layers:** Remove opaque subcontracting chains so value flows directly to those who create it.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- Relentlessly pursue fairness, transparency, and a calm user experience.
- Place trust in technology, not human authority.
- Make all rules and processes as open and auditable as possible.
- Treat every failure as a learning opportunity.
- Prioritize user trust and peace of mind above all else.

## 3. The Role of AI: From Generator to Ethical Guardian

AI is not just an automation tool, but the **ethical guardian** of the platform—making fair judgments and guiding users.

- **From Generation to Judgment:** AI not only generates information, but also judges concepts like fairness, ethics, and viability from transaction data.
- **M-Score (Moral Score):** Measures fairness, transparency, and cooperation (e.g., contract clarity, communication quality).
- **S-Score (Survival Score):** Measures risk, efficiency, and profitability (e.g., payment delays, budget adequacy).
- **Purpose:** Clearly communicate “quality of peace of mind” to users, enabling value-aligned choices. Internally, AI learns from all features and translates results into these two scores for user explanation.
- **AI as Arbiter:** Makes objective decisions based on rules and data.
- **AI as Conscience:** Detects and warns about behaviors that may harm community health, even if not rule violations.
- **AI as Guide:** Suggests better ways of working and new, non-monetary meanings of work.

## 4. System Design Assuming Malice

Waritsu is designed on the assumption that bad actors exist, making malicious behavior systematically unprofitable.

- **Absolute Clarity in Contracts:** AI guides clients to define deliverables, acceptance criteria, and scope in detail. AI calculates an “ambiguity score” and prompts corrections.
- **User Input and Agreement:** Users provide minimal input; AI drafts detailed requirements. Both parties must review and agree before work begins. Any post-contract changes require a new, explicit change order with fees and deadlines.
- **Objective Acceptance and AI Quality Checks:** Detailed acceptance criteria are set at contract stage. AI automatically checks deliverables for quality (e.g., code analysis, design pixel checks, plagiarism detection, data validation).
- **Milestone-Based Payments:** Payments are only released when milestone deliverables meet acceptance criteria, removing incentives for low-quality work.
- **Dispute Reduction:** Milestone tracking reduces ambiguity and disputes.
- **Escrow Principle:** Full contract amount is deposited in Waritsu’s escrow before work starts, preventing payment refusal due to lack of funds.
- **AI Detection of Unfair Demands:** AI analyzes communication logs to detect and warn about out-of-scope or unfair client demands.
- **Automatic Payment Triggers:** If acceptance criteria are objectively met or the client does not provide a valid rejection within a set period, escrow funds are released automatically.

## 5. Foundations for Reliability

- **Immutable Digital Trust Records:** All agreements, messages, and submissions are recorded immutably. Cryptographic hashes and chaining are used internally; for key events, blockchain notarization or third-party timestamping may be used.
- **Transparency and Trust:** All transactions, contracts, and reviews are stored on blockchain, with public rating and history systems.
- **User Reliability Profiles:** AI learns each user’s respect for rules and builds a reliability profile, affecting recommendations and platform privileges.
- **Compliance & Security:** KYC/AML as needed; sensitive data is encrypted and securely managed.
- **User Experience:** Minimize manual input, maximize AI assistance, and use templates and intuitive flows to reduce risk and confusion.

## 6. Initial Operation and Roadmap

- **Cold Start:** Early on, combine rule-based engines and manual curation to collect training data for AI.
- **Phased AI Introduction:** As data accumulates, shift to general-purpose LLMs, then to proprietary models.
- **Legal Readiness:** All records are stored as legal evidence. Terms specify jurisdiction and dispute resolution, prioritizing platform mediation before litigation.
- **Reducing Arbitration Burden:** Milestone tracking reduces disputes.
- **AI Decision Transparency:** Ensure explainability and audit trails.
